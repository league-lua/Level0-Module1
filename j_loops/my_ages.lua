-- This program will use loops to print all the ages you have been alive, 
-- from zero up to your current age.

-- Make a variable called age, to track how many times the loop has repeated
--        Start its value at zero.

-- Use the value of yourCurrentAge to ask the user they're current age
-- Use tonumber() so Lua treats the input as a number



--  WHILE LOOP. Start a while loop to repeat while age <= yourCurrentAge

  --  Print the age variable
  
  --  Add one to the age variable
  
--  End the while loop here

--  Run the program. Did it print all your ages from 0 to your current age?

--[[ Now you are going to do the same thing, but this time use a for loop. 
		 Notice how most of the information is the same, it is just written 
		 in a different way.
--]]

--  FOR LOOP. Start a for loop to repeat while age is less than your age, like this:
--  for age=0, yourCurrentAge  do

  --  Print the age variable
  
--  End the for loop here

--  Run the program again. 		
--  Check that both loops printed the same numbers to the console

-- FOR LOOP WITH STEP. Now use a for loop to count down from current age to 0, like this
-- for age = yourCurrentAge, 0, -1 do
